        "----------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "1)What is hypothesis testing in statistics?\n",
        "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about a population parameter based on sample data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
        "The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no effect or difference, while the alternative hypothesis suggests there is an effect or difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
        "The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, often set at 0.05.\n",
        "\n",
        "4)What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "A P-value represents the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "5)How do you interpret the P-value in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "A low P-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection.\n",
        "\n",
        "6)What are Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected, while Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly not rejected.\n",
        "\n",
        "7)What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "A one-tailed test tests for an effect in one direction, while a two-tailed test tests for an effect in both directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "8)What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "The Z-test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between sample and population means, typically when the sample size is large.\n",
        "\n",
        "9)How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "The Z-score is calculated as (sample mean - population mean) / (population standard deviation / √n), representing the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "10)What is the T-distribution, and when should it be used instead of the normal distribution?\n",
        "The T-distribution is used when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown, providing more conservative estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "11)What is the difference between a Z-test and a T-test?\n",
        "A Z-test is used for large samples with known population variance, while a T-test is used for small samples with unknown population variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "12)What is the T-test, and how is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "The T-test compares the means of two groups to determine if they are statistically different from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "13)What is the relationship between Z-test and T-test in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "Both tests compare means, but the Z-test is for large samples with known variance, and the T-test is for small samples with unknown variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14)What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?\n",
        "A confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie, with a certain level of confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "15)What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval?\n",
        "The margin of error indicates the range of uncertainty around the sample estimate, affecting the width of the confidence interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "16)How is Bayes' Theorem used in statistics, and what is its significance?\n",
        "Bayes' Theorem updates the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available, significant for incorporating prior knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "17)What is the Chi-square distribution, and when is it used?\n",
        "The Chi-square distribution is used in tests of independence and goodness of fit, particularly for categorical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "18)What is the Chi-square goodness of fit test, and how is it applied?\n",
        "The Chi-square goodness of fit test determines if sample data matches a population with a specific distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "19)What is the F-distribution, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "The F-distribution is used in ANOVA and regression analysis to compare variances and test overall model significance.\n",
        "\n",
        "20)What is an ANOVA test, and what are its assumptions?\n",
        "ANOVA tests differences among group means, assuming normality, homogeneity of variance, and independent samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "21)What are the different types of ANOVA tests?\n",
        "Types include one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA, each suited for different experimental designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "22)What is the F-test, and how does it relate to hypothesis testing?\n",
        "The F-test compares variances to determine if group means are significantly different, often used in ANOVA.\n",
